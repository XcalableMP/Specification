\section{Interface to Numerical Libraries}

   This section describe XcalableMP interfaces to existing MPI parallel library, 
   in order to develop good productive and high performance XcalableMP programs 
   using existing MPI parallel libraries.
   
\subsection{ScaLAPACK}

   This subsection shows main characteristics in case of developing
   XcalableMP programs using XcalableMP interfaces to ScaLAPACK library routines.

\begin{itemize}
\item The name of XcalableMP interface prefixes "XMP\_" or "xmp\_" 
      to ScaLAPACK library routine name.
\item Execution flow is the following:\\
      XMP programs $\to$ XMP interface $\to$ native ScaLAPACK library routines
\item If arguments of subroutines have array descriptor,
      we replace the argument with "xmp\_desc\_of".
      Then we don't need array descriptor. 
\item For ScaLAPACK library routine having descriptor array as argumet,
      the XcalableMP interface routine have BLACS context handle including 
      the descriptor array as new argument.
\item The blacs\_exit routine is unnecessary, because XcalableMP program executes process 
      corresponding to MPI\_Finalize routines.
\item A valid value of the argument "order" of BLACS routine "blacs\_gridinit" is 
      only column-major. 
\end{itemize}
