\chapter{Directives}\index{directive}

This chapter describes the syntax and behavior of \XMP directives.
In this document, the following notation is used to describe \XMP
directives. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt xxx} & {\tt type-face} characters are used to indicate literal type characters. \\
{\it xxx ...} & If the line is followed by ``...'', then xxx can be
repeated. \\
{\it [xxx]} & {\it xxx} is optional. \\
\verb![F]! & The following lines are effective only in \Fort. \\
\verb![C]! & The following lines are effective only in \C. \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

In \C, \XMP
directives are specified using the \verb|#pragma| mechanism provided by \C
standards. In \Fort, \XMP directives are specified using
special comments that are identified by unique sentinels
{\tt\verb|!$xmp|}. The rules of \Fort directives in fixed source format
and free source format follow those in \OMP and HPF.

Directives are classified as declarative directives and
executable directives. The \Directive{declarative directive} is a directive that may
only be placed in a declarative context. A declarative directive has no
associated executable user code. The scope rule of declarative
directives obeys one of the declaration statements in the base
language. For example, in C, node declarations by {\tt node} directives are
effective from the declared point to the end of the file, and, in \Fort, node declarations by {\tt node} directives are effective within the subprogram.

{\Directive{Executable} directives are placed in executable
context. A stand-alone directive is an executable directive that has
no associated user code, such as a {\tt barrier} directive. Some executable
directives compose directive constructs using an associated user code, as
in the following format:

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\verb![F]! & \verb|!$xmp| {\it directive-name clause} ...\\
 & \hspace{0.5cm} {\it statement} \\
 & \hspace{0.5cm} ... \\
 & \verb|!$xmp| {\tt end} {\it directive-name} \\
\end{tabular}
\vspace{0.3cm}

Note that in the {\tt loop} construct, {\tt end} can be omitted.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\verb![F]! & \verb|!$xmp| {\it directive-name clause} ...\\
 & \hspace{0.5cm} {\it do-loop-construct} \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\verb![C]! & \verb|#pragma xmp| {\it directive-name clause} ...\\
 & \hspace{0.5cm} {\it statement} \\
\end{tabular}

In C, the statement can be a compound-statement.
