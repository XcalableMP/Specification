%array construct is synchronous.  But semantically OK?

This chapter explains a memory consistency model that XcalableMP adopts.

Memory consistency models specify rules about multiple data accesses
to memories.  Since XcalableMP is an extension of the base languages,
its memory consistency model is also defined to be their extension,
that is, XcalableMP adopts all the rules that base languages do.

In addition, XcalableMP adopts some rules.  XcalableMP provides
\emph{global view} that the base languages do not.  In global view,
\emph{global communication constructs} are used to access distributed
data.  Furthermore, distributed data can be accessed through
designating data in local view.  Conversely, non-distributed data can
be accessed through designating distributed data by using global
communication constructs in global view.  These, of course, are not
considered under the memory consistency models of the base language.
Therefore, XcalableMP memory consistency model adopts additional rules
about global communication constructs.

Recall that global communication constructs are collective as
described in Section~\ref{sec:glossary}.

\section{Execution Traces}

This section explains execution traces that Xcalable memory
consistency model admits.

First, instructions are defined as
\[
i \Coloneqq \xsync \mid \xasync{\textit{async-id}} \mid \waitasync{\textit{async-id}} \mid \fstmt
\]
where $\xsync$ denotes a global communication construct with no
\texttt{async} clause, $\xasync{\textit{async-id}}$ denotes a global
communication construct with the clause
$\texttt{async}(\textit{async-id})$,
%$\waitasync{\textit{async-id}}$ denotes a
%\texttt{wait\_async}(\textit{async-id}),
and $\fstmt$ is a statement.

Next, operations are defined as
\[
o \Coloneqq \F{j}{i} \mid \E{j}{i} \mid \R{j}{i}
\]
where $j$ is a positive integer.

Operation $\F{j}{i}$ denotes that instruction $i$ is fetched at $j$
times.  The integer $j$ is incremented whenever you break or exit
loops.  The instructions that are called at multiple times in loops
are indentified by $j$s.  Operation $\E{j}{i}$ denotes that
instruction $i$ is executed.  Operation $\R{j}{i}$ denotes that effect
of instruction $i$ is reflected to physical memories.

Finally, the memory consistency model defines constraints written by a
partial order $\leq$ on operations as described below.  Execution
traces are defined as sequences of operations that follow the order.
In the following, $o_1 < o_2$ denotes $o_1 \leq o_2$ and $o_1
\not\equiv o_2$, and $o_1 < o_2 < o_3$ denotes $o_1 < o_2$ and $o_2 <
o_3$.

\subsection{Common Constraints}

This subsection explains some constraints that are common between
synchronous and asynchronous communications.

In XcalableMP memory consistency model, instructions are executed in
the order in which they are fetched.  Formally, this is represented by
\ref{constraints:fetchorder} in Figure~\ref{fig:constraints}.

\subsection{Constraints for Synchronous Communications}

The constructs \texttt{reflect}, \texttt{gmove} (and its following
assignment statement), \texttt{reduction}, and \texttt{bcast} are
synchronous if \texttt{async} is not specified.  It means that
executions of these constructs guarantee completions of data
synchronizations, that is, global communication constructs read data
that are written by statements that are previously executed, and their
following statements and global communication constructs read data
written by global communication constructs.  This is guaranteed even
if the distributed data are accessed in local view.  Formally, this is
represented by \ref{constraints:synchronous} in
Figure~\ref{fig:constraints}

For example, in the following code, the assignment statement \texttt{l(1)=1} is
guaranteed to be completed before the \texttt{gmove} construct is
executed.  Therefore, the value of \texttt{g(6)} must be \texttt{1}.
Furthermore, since the \texttt{gmove} construct completes before the
assignment statement \texttt{x=m(2)} is executed, the value of \texttt{x} on
\texttt{p(1)} must be \texttt{1}.
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer :: l(10), m(10)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h
      integer x

      l(1)=1
!$xmp gmove
      h(2)=g(6)
      x=m(2)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

Similarly, these are also guaranteed when an integer \texttt{1} is
stored at \texttt{g(6)} through a coarray \texttt{l} as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :; g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer :; l(10), m(10)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h
!$xmp coarray on p :: l(:)[*]
      integer x

      l(1)[2]=1
!$xmp gmove
      h(2)=g(6)
      x=m(2)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

Remark that synchronous global communication constructs do not
guarantee completions of data are written by asynchronous global
communication constructs that are previously executed.  For example,
in the following code, the value of \texttt{x} may be \texttt{1} or
\texttt{2}.

\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :; g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer :; l(10), m(10)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h
!$xmp coarray on p :: l(:)[*]
      integer x

      l(1)[2]=1
!$xmp gmove async(1)
      g(7)=g(1)+1
!$xmp gmove
      h(2)=g(7)
      x=m(2)
!$xmp wait_async(1)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

\subsection{Constraints for Asynchronous Communications}

The constructs \texttt{reflect}, \texttt{gmove} (and its following
assignment statement), \texttt{reduction}, and \texttt{bcast} are
asynchronous if \texttt{async}s are specified.  Completions of data
read and written by these global communication constructs are not
guaranteed until \texttt{wait\_async}s are executed.
Formally, this is represented by
\ref{constraints:asynchronous} in Figure~\ref{fig:constraints}.

For example, in the following code, the assignment statement \texttt{l(1)=1} may
not be completed before the \texttt{gmove} construct is executed.
Therefore, the value of \texttt{g(6)} is undefined.  Moreover, since
the \texttt{gmove} construct may not complete before the assignment statement
\texttt{x=m(2)} is executed, the value of \texttt{x} on \texttt{p(1)}
is undefined even if the value of \texttt{g(6)} is \texttt{1}.  This
is also the case with coarrays.
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer :: l(10), m(10)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h
      integer x

      l(1)=1
!$xmp gmove async(1)
      h(2)=g(6)
      x=m(2)
!$xmp wait_async(1)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

The \texttt{wait\_async(\textit{async-id})} guarantees a completion of
a global communication construct that has \textit{async-id}.  However,
it does not guarantee that an effect of an assignment statement that
follows the global communication construct is kept.

For example, in the following code, the value of \texttt{x} is
undefined, that is, may be \texttt{1}, \texttt{2}, or anything else.
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer :: l(10), m(10)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h
      integer x

      l(1)=1
!$xmp gmove async(1)
      h(2)=g(6)
      m(2)=2
!$xmp wait_async(1)
      x=m(2)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}
