This chapter explains the memory consistency model that is adopted by XcalableMP.

Memory consistency models have specified rules regarding multiple data
accesses to memory.  Because XcalableMP is an extension of the base
languages, and its memory consistency model is defined as an extension
to them, that is, XcalableMP follows all of the rules that are adopted
by base languages.

In addition, XcalableMP introduces some rules about \emph{global
  view}.  In global view, \emph{global communication constructs} are
used to access distributed data.  Furthermore, distributed data can be
accessed by designating data in local view.  Conversely,
non-distributed data can be accessed by designating distributed data
using global communication constructs in global view.  These are not
considered under the memory consistency models of the base language
because global view is a new concept that was introduced by
XcalableMP.

Please recall that global communication constructs are collective as
described in Section~\ref{sec:glossary}.

\section{Execution Traces}

This section explains execution traces that are enabled by the
Xcalable memory consistency model.

First, instructions are defined as
\[
i \Coloneqq \xsync \mid \xasync{\textit{async-id}} \mid \waitasync{\textit{async-id}} \mid \fstmt
\]
where $\xsync$ denotes a global communication construct with no
\texttt{async} clause, $\xasync{\textit{async-id}}$ denotes a global
communication construct with the clause
$\texttt{async}(\textit{async-id})$,
%$\waitasync{\textit{async-id}}$ denotes a
%\texttt{wait\_async}(\textit{async-id}),
and $\fstmt$ is a statement.

Next, operations are defined as
\[
o \Coloneqq \F{j}{i} \mid \E{j}{i} \mid \R{j}{i}
\]
where $j$ is a positive integer.

Operation $\F{j}{i}$ denotes that instruction $i$ is fetched $j$
times.  The integer $j$ is incremented whenever a loop is exited.  The
instructions that are called multiple times in loops are identified by
$j$s.  Operation $\E{j}{i}$ denotes that instruction $i$ is executed,
while operation $\R{j}{i}$ denotes that the effect of instruction $i$
is saved to physical memories.

Finally, the memory consistency model defines constraints written by a
partial order $\leq$ on operations as described below.  Execution
traces are defined as sequences of operations that follow the order.
In the following, $o_1 < o_2$ denotes $o_1 \leq o_2$ and $o_1
\not\equiv o_2$.  In addition, $o_1 < o_2 < o_3$ denotes $o_1 < o_2$
and $o_2 < o_3$.

\subsection{Common Constraints}

In this subsection, we explain some constraints that are common to both
synchronous and asynchronous communications.

In the XcalableMP memory consistency model, instructions are executed in
the order in which they are fetched.  This is represented by
\ref{constraints:fetchorder} in Figure~\ref{fig:constraints}.

\subsection{Constraints for Synchronous Communications}

The constructs \texttt{reflect}, \texttt{gmove} (and its subsequent
assignment statement), \texttt{reduction}, and \texttt{bcast} are
synchronous if \texttt{async} is not specified.  This means that
executions of these constructs guarantee the completion of data
synchronization.  That is, global communication constructs read data
that are written by previously executed statements, and their
subsequent statements and global communication constructs read data
that are written by global communication constructs.  This is given by
\ref{constraints:synchronous} in Figure~\ref{fig:constraints}

For example, in the following code, the assignment statement
\texttt{g(:)=h(:)} is guaranteed to be completed before the second
\texttt{gmove} construct is executed.  Therefore, the value of
\texttt{g(i)} must be \texttt{i} when the assignment statement
\texttt{x(:)=g(6:10)} is executed.

Finally, the value of \texttt{x(i)} on \texttt{p(1)} should be
\texttt{i+5}.

\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer x(5)

!$xmp loop on t(i)
      do i=1,10
      h(i)=i
      end do

!$xmp gmove
      g(:)=h(:)
!$xmp gmove
      x(:)=g(6:10)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

\subsection{Constraints for Asynchronous Communications}

The constructs \texttt{reflect}, \texttt{gmove} (and its following
assignment statement), \texttt{reduction}, and \texttt{bcast} are
asynchronous if \texttt{async}s are specified.  Completions of data
read and written by these global communication constructs are not
guaranteed until \texttt{wait\_async}s are executed.  This is
represented by \ref{constraints:asynchronous} in
Figure~\ref{fig:constraints}.

For example, in the following code, the assignment statement
\texttt{g(:)=h(:)} may not be completed before the second
\texttt{gmove} construct is executed as the first \texttt{gmove}
construct has \texttt{async} clause.  Therefore, the value of
\texttt{g(i)} is not guaranteed to be \texttt{i+5}.  Of course, the
value of \texttt{x(i)} on \texttt{p(1)} is not guaranteed to be
\texttt{i+5}.
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer x(5)

!$xmp loop on t(i)
      do i=1,10
      h(i)=i
      end do

!$xmp gmove async(1)
      g(:)=h(:)
!$xmp gmove
      x(:)=g(6:10)
!$xmp wait_async(1)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

The \texttt{wait\_async(\textit{async-id})} guarantees the completion
of a global communication construct that has \textit{async-id}.
Therefore, the value of \texttt{x(i)} is not guaranteed to be
\texttt{i+5} in the following program:
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer x(5)

!$xmp loop on t(i)
      do i=1,10
      h(i)=i
      end do

!$xmp gmove async(1)
      g(:)=h(:)
!$xmp wait_async(1)
!$xmp gmove
      x(:)=g(6:10)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

Assignment statements in local view and \texttt{gmove} constructs in
global view may race.  The value of \texttt{x(5)} is not guaranteed to
be \texttt{6}, and may be \texttt{10} in the following program:
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer x(5)

      integer l(5), m(5)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h

!$xmp loop on t(i)
      do i=1,10
      h(i)=i
      end do

!$xmp gmove async(1)
      g(:)=h(:)
      l(5)=6
!$xmp wait_async(1)
      x(5)=l(5)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

By avoiding the race, the value of \texttt{x(5)} is guaranteed to
be \texttt{6} as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer x(5)
      integer l(5), m(5)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h

!$xmp loop on t(i)
      do i=1,10
      h(i)=i
      end do

!$xmp gmove async(1)
      g(:)=h(:)
!$xmp wait_async(1)
      l(5)=6
      x(5)=l(5)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}

Please note that function calls have no synchronization at its
entrance/exit.  In the following program, the value of \texttt{x(5)}
is not guaranteed to be \texttt{6}:
\begin{center}
\begin{XFexample}
!$xmp nodes p(2)
!$xmp template t(10)
!$xmp distribute (block) onto p :: t
      integer :: g(10), h(10)
!$xmp align (i) with t(i) :: g, h
      integer x(5)
      integer l(5), m(5)
!$xmp local_alias l => g
!$xmp local_alias m => h

!$xmp loop on t(i)
      do i=1,10
      h(i)=i
      end do

!$xmp gmove async(1)
      call sub(g,h)
      l(5)=6
!$xmp wait_async(1)
      x(5)=l(5)
\end{XFexample}
\end{center}
