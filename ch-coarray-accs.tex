\begin{Constraints C}
\item A coarray variable shall not be pointer-assigned.
\end{Constraints C}

{\onlyF}
A cosubscript of the coarray in that codimension shall not be less than the lower
cobound or greater than the upper cobound.

{\onlyC}
A cosubscript of the coarray in that codimension shall be less than the coextent
and shall not be less than 0.


\subsubsection*{Note}
In {\XMPC}, after the following declaration:
\begin{verbatim}
            static double a1[10]:[*][4];
\end{verbatim}
{\tt a1} is not a coarray but a pointer to the coarray on this image.
The coarray is referred as {\tt a1[:]} using the notation defined in 
Chapter~\ref{chap:Base Language Extensions in {\XMPC}}.
In contrast, for a basic type variable {\tt v1} and a {\tt struct} 
variable {\tt s1}:
\begin{verbatim}
            static int b1:[*][4];
            static struct {int n; double a;} s1:[*][4];
\end{verbatim}
variables {\tt b1} and {\tt s1} are the coarrays.
